# Mining workflow

Run [`cytominer-database`](https://github.com/cytomining/cytominer-database) ingest to 
create a huge SQLite database with all the 
extracted CellProfiler features.  Also run a 
[`pycytominer`](https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer) 
aggregation step to create a distilled, smaller CSV file.
