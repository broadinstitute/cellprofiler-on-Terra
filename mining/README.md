Run [`cytominer`](https://github.com/cytomining/cytominer) database ingest to 
create a huge SQLite database with all the 
extracted CellProfiler features.  Also run a 
[`pycytominer`](https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer) 
aggregation step to create a distilled, smaller CSV file.

See the [workflow here](https://portal.firecloud.org/#methods/bayer-pcl-cell-imaging/cytomining/11)

See a description of how this workflow fits into a CellPainting analysis pipeline 
in the README in the "cellprofiler_distributed" folder.
